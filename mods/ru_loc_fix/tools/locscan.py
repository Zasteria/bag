"""What is wrong with the game's own Russian localization, asked of the files.

The player runs EU5 in Russian. The Russian localization Paradox ships is not a
translation of the English strings so much as a rewrite of them, and the rewrite
damaged the markup in places: brackets that were never closed, a scope name that
does not exist in that context, a data function that lost an argument. The
engine does not render those keys at all — it writes a line to `error.log` or to
`gui.log` and leaves the text blank or half printed.

This module is the list of ways that damage shows up, written as rules that can
be asked of every key in the tree at once. Each rule was put here because a real
key tripped it and the game complained; the comment on each names the evidence.

The rules split in two:

**Hard** rules cannot fire on a healthy key. An unbalanced bracket is broken in
any language, in any context, with no exception — so a hard rule firing is a bug
and nothing else, and `generate.py` will let a fix ship on the strength of one.

**Advisory** rules compare the Russian key against the English key of the same
name and report a difference that is *usually* damage. Russian legitimately
rearranges a sentence, and a rewritten string may reference a scope the English
one had no use for, so these need a person to look. `generate.py` will not
accept an advisory rule alone as the reason for a fix; say what the game logged.

Run it to see the current state of the tree:

    python3 mods/ru_loc_fix/tools/locscan.py              every rule, summarised
    python3 mods/ru_loc_fix/tools/locscan.py --rule brackets

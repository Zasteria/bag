"""Availability gates for the extra societal value hints.

Reads the game files a second time to learn, per object, what a country needs in
order for that object to be reachable at all - so hints for other religions,
other estates or other subject types stop showing up.

Only triggers whose exact syntax is confirmed by usage in the shipped game files
are emitted. Anything unconfirmed is left ungated rather than guessed at: a
mistyped trigger is a load error, an ungated hint is only noise.

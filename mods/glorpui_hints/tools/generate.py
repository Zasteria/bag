"""Rebuild `glorpui_hints` from Glorp UI, and refuse to write it broken.

Two things live in this mod, and they are rebuilt on different occasions:

* **Glorp UI's hint text** is its own English file with the opener replaced,
  once per language, so a Glorp UI update that adds hints is picked up in all
  eleven languages without anyone noticing it happened. Regenerated every run.
* **The extra hint lists** are compiled out of the *game's* `common/` tree —
  laws, static modifiers, religious aspects, employment systems and the rest —
  which is large, so they are committed as generated files and rebuilt only when
  asked:

      python3 mods/glorpui_hints/tools/generate.py --game-files reference/game

What runs unconditionally is the part that catches the update this mod is most
likely to be broken by. The mod **overrides Glorp UI's own override** of
`SocietalValueCountryLeft_tooltip` / `SocietalValueCountryRight_tooltip`, and it
re-emits Glorp UI's list inside it. If Glorp UI restructures those templates,
nothing errors at load: the player simply gets our older copy of Glorp UI's list
and never sees whatever Glorp UI added. So the checks below compare the two
files every run and fail naming the difference.

    python3 mods/glorpui_hints/tools/generate.py
    python3 mods/glorpui_hints/tools/generate.py --check    # write nothing

And when Glorp UI has moved and the question is what that costs:

    python3 mods/glorpui_hints/tools/generate.py --conflicts

which lists the three — only three — places this mod writes over Glorp UI's own
work, and says whether the copy here is still theirs. Run it before a rebuild
and after one: the first says what their update changed, the second says whether
the rebuild picked it up.

# Which languages get Glorp UI's whole hint text from here rather than from
# Glorp UI.
#
# Until 2026-08-28 the answer was all eleven, because Glorp UI shipped English
# and nothing else and the other ten rendered as raw keys — that was this mod's
# reason to exist. Their build of that day ships all eleven itself, in the
# opener-per-language shape this mod worked out; the Korean is 179 keys
# identical to ours. So re-emitting them is an override that changes nothing and
# pins their file against every update they make, in ten languages nobody here

# Russian stays, because it is the language the owner plays and reads, and he

# UI's own text is what the player gets, and this mod ships only the handful of
# hints it actually changes — the ones an advance has to unlock first, which

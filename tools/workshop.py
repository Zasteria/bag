"""What the Steam Workshop has now, and how it gets from there into git.

The mods in `reference/` are other people's, and they update whenever their
authors feel like it. Until now that loop was entirely manual and entirely in
the owner's head: notice an update somehow, unsubscribe and resubscribe to make
Steam actually fetch it, find the folder, copy it in, commit, push, and only
then find out whether the update moved anything a mod here compiles from.

This tool is that loop, minus the parts a machine can do.

    python3 tools/workshop.py                    what the workshop has vs what is here
    python3 tools/workshop.py sync               copy the newer ones in, rebuild, commit
    python3 tools/workshop.py record             stamp the copies here as current
    python3 tools/workshop.py playset            the rest of the playset, text only

`status` needs no Steam, no account and no game — it asks Steam's public
`GetPublishedFileDetails` for the tracked ids and compares the answer against
`reference/workshop_generated_state.json`, which is what the last sync wrote
down. That is why it can run on GitHub on a schedule and open an issue saying
which mod moved: see `.github/workflows/workshop-check.yml`.

`sync` needs the files, and the files only exist on a machine that owns the
game. **Anonymous download does not work** — `steamcmd +login anonymous
+workshop_download_item 3450310 <id>` answers `ERROR! Download item failed
(Failure)` for this app, which was measured, not assumed. So nothing can pull a
workshop mod straight into GitHub; the shortest honest loop is: the owner's box
already has the files, and this copies them in and pushes in one command.

    python3 tools/workshop.py sync --commit --push

Without `--from` it looks for `steamapps/workshop/content/3450310/` in the usual
Steam locations. With `--steamcmd` it runs steamcmd first, logged in as the
owner, which fetches the current version of each tracked id without touching
subscriptions — that is the answer to having to unsubscribe and resubscribe to
make Steam notice an update.

There is a PowerShell twin, `tools/sync_workshop.ps1`, for the Windows box: same
copy, same commit, no Python needed.

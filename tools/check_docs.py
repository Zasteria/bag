"""Check that the documents still describe the repository that exists.

Everything here is written down so a session with no memory can trust it. That
only works while it is true, and the ways it stops being true are dull and
repeatable: a mod is deleted and four documents still link to it, a folder in
`reference/` is renamed and the path in a code block is now wrong, a mod updates
and a version typed into prose quietly becomes a lie.

    python3 tools/check_docs.py

Each rule below exists because the mistake was actually made in this repository.
Two of them are hard failures — a path that does not exist, and a reference
folder named literally. Versions written in prose are only listed, because a
version is a lie when it claims what is in the tree and a fact when it records
what something was checked against, and no regular expression can tell those
apart.

A line carrying `check-docs: ignore` is skipped, for the case where a document
deliberately talks about something that is gone.

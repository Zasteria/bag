"""The mod manager: the workshop, the game's own copies, and this repository.

Everything the owner has to do by hand for a mod update, in one place and with
no session of mine in the loop:

    python3 tools/mods.py           the menu
    python3 tools/mods.py check     just the answer, for a script or a shortcut

What it can do, in the order the work actually happens:

1. **Look at every mod he is subscribed to** — not the five this repository
   tracks — and say which ones the workshop has moved on since Steam last
   downloaded them. That comparison is between Steam's own record of what is
   installed (`appworkshop_3450310.acf`) and Steam's public
   `GetPublishedFileDetails`, **by build id** — the `manifest` on one side
   against `hcontent_file` on the other — rather than by dates. Dates are what
   made this loop untrustworthy: Steam stamps an item as updated when it
   notices the update, which is not the same as having downloaded it, so a mod
   could read as current and load as the old version in game. Two build ids
   that differ are two different sets of files, and nothing about that is a
   guess. Anything Steam has no build id for falls back to the dates, and the
   report says which of the two answered.

2. **Download the ones he picks, into the game's own workshop folder**, so the
   next launch loads them. Steam itself will not be told to do this on demand —
   hence the unsubscribe-and-resubscribe dance this replaces — so it is done
   with `steamcmd` under his own account and the result is copied over
   `steamapps/workshop/content/3450310/<id>/`, which is where the game reads
   mods from. Anonymous does not work for this app; that was measured. Any mod
   can be re-fetched on demand, whether or not the check thinks it is behind —
   "ничего не отстаёт" is exactly the answer that used to be wrong. What
   steamcmd actually brought back is checked against what the workshop serves,
   and written down here, because Steam's own record still names the build
   *Steam* downloaded.

3. **Update the copies in this repository**, either kind: `reference/mods/` for
   the mods something here is built against (whole, unedited) and
   `reference/playset/` for the rest (text only). Then rebuild everything
   generated from them and say what moved. This copies out of the Steam folder,
   so a mod Steam has not actually fetched would be copied in stale and every
   generator would rebuild against the old files without a word — it stops and
   offers to download first instead.

4. **Move a mod between those two**, which is the only decision in here that
   changes what this repository watches: promoting one adds it to
   `tools/workshop_mods.txt` and it starts arriving whole and getting checked
   daily on GitHub; demoting one puts it back in the text-only tree.

5. **Commit and push**, to whatever branch he says, `main` included.

Nothing here needs the repository to be checked out anywhere in particular and
nothing needs a session: steps 1 and 2 do not touch git at all, so it is
usable as a mod updater on a day when modding is the last thing on his mind.

Settings that are his rather than the repository's — where steamcmd lives, which
Steam account, which branch — go in `tools/mods.local.json`, which is ignored by
git.

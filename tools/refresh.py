"""The one command to run after `reference/` is refreshed.

The owner updates the game files and the workshop mods by hand, at no fixed
time and under whatever folder names the upload produced. Nothing in this
repository needs to be told about it — but the generated files do have to be
rebuilt, because they are compiled out of exactly those files, and it is worth
seeing *what* the update moved underneath the mods.

    python3 tools/refresh.py

It re-reads the inventory, runs every generator, and then reports which
generated files changed. A clean report means the update touched nothing this
repository depends on. A changed file is not a problem by itself — it is the
patch's effect, made visible, and `git diff` says what it was.

Add `--check` to leave nothing changed on disk and only report, which is what a
session should run before trusting anything a doc says about the tree.

Add `--brief` to hear from a generator only when it has something to say — a
failure, a remark it made on stderr, or a file it actually changed. That is the
shape the mod menu wants:
the full report is reassuring the first time and noise the twentieth, and it
reads as though the generators were rewriting mods that nobody touched.

# Pitfalls — publishing and loading

Split out of [`../PITFALLS.md`](../PITFALLS.md) when it outgrew its budget: what
goes wrong between a mod being written and a player actually running it. Same
rule as the rest of that file — every entry cost at least one round trip, and
none of them raises an error you would notice.

Ask for one rather than reading the file: `python3 tools/kb.py <words>`.

## Publishing

**The workshop's tag list is fixed, and a tag outside it is dropped rather than
refused.** Four mods here were filed under `Localization`, which EU5 does not
have; the tag it does have is `Translation`, and `Economy` is really
`Trade and Economics`. The upload says nothing, the mod simply ends up in no
category on a hub where people browse by category. The list read off the hub's
own filter sidebar is `WORKSHOP_TAGS` in
[`../tools/publish.py`](../tools/publish.py), and `python3 tools/publish.py`
checks every mod against it along with the version format, the thumbnail and the
BOM.

**The Steam app id for EU5 is `3450310`.** The wiki's PDX Workshop Manager page
says `529340`, which is Imperator: Rome. `3450310` is the one `steamcmd` in
`tools/workshop.py` actually downloads with.

## Loading

**Later file wins for a duplicate database key, and files sort by name.** A mod
redeclaring `sheep_farms` in `00_sheep_farm_food_buildings.txt` loses to
vanilla's `rural_buildings.txt`, because `00_` sorts first. The `00_` prefix is
for files that must load *early*; to override, sort late. Symptom: mod loads,
changes nothing, logs nothing.

**`metadata.json` needs `"game_id": "eu5"`.** Every working mod has it. Without
it the launcher does not treat the folder as an EU5 mod.

**Overriding another mod's *generated* override goes stale in complete
silence.** `mods/glorpui_hints/` overrides Glorp UI's override of the societal
value tooltip templates, and to keep Glorp UI's own hint lists it re-emits them
inside its own file. When Glorp UI regenerates those templates — which it does
on every game patch — nothing errors: the templates still parse, the mod still
loads, and the player quietly gets a months-old copy of Glorp UI's list with
whatever Glorp UI added missing from it. `error.log` says nothing, because
nothing failed. The only defence is a checker that compares the two files, so
`mods/glorpui_hints/tools/generate.py` reduces both to an ordered sequence of
(gating script value, title, body key) and fails naming the difference. Any mod
that copies another mod's generated file needs the same check written the same
day the copy is made.

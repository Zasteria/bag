# Town rights, and how `where_to_produce` should score them

The owner asked for Городские права: a location can be granted an urban right
that trades a small penalty on all its production for a large bonus to one
bundle of goods, and he wants the mod to find the best ground for the bundle.

Written before any of it was built, because the arithmetic decides the shape and
two of the four numbers people assume are wrong. The output half is built now
and has never been loaded; the level half is deferred. `common/town_rights` is in
`reference/` since 2026-08-31 — the owner copied it in by hand after `mods.bat
→ 2` turned out not to re-extract the game.

## What the seventeen production rights actually do

`python3 tools/api.py --find town_rights` for the engine side;
`reference/game/in_game/common/town_rights/` for these.

| right | what it grants |
| --- | --- |
| `royal_tooling_rights` | tools +30% |
| `royal_masonry_rights` | masonry +25%, glass +25% |
| `royal_naval_rights` | naval supplies +30%, tar +30% |
| `royal_textile_rights` | cloth +20%, fine cloth +20%, dyes +20% |
| `royal_book_rights` | paper +20%, books +20%, dyes +20% |
| `royal_weaponry_rights` | weaponry +20%, firearms +20%, cannons +20% |
| `royal_artisan_rights` | furniture +20%, pottery +20%, leather +20% |
| `royal_brewing_rights` | liquor +20%, beer +20%, wine +20% |
| `royal_jewelry_rights` | jewelry +20% **and** jewelry guild +10 levels |
| `constantinopolitan_silk_monopoly_rights` | silk +50%, cloth +25%, fine cloth +10% |
| `scandinavian_tar_privileges` | tar +20%, naval supplies +20% |
| `scandinavian_bergslag_privileges` | tools +10% |
| `flemish_cloth_industries_right` | cloth guild +5 levels, fine cloth guild +5 |
| `staple_port`, `market_charter`, `lubeck_town_rights`, `stapelrecht_town_rights` | marketplace +3…+10 levels — trade, not production |

Eleven of them also carry `local_production_efficiency =
town_right_efficiency_penalty`, which is **not defined anywhere in
`reference/`** — referenced by the rights and by nothing else we hold.

All nine general ones come from one advance, `town_rights_enable`, in
**age 3 (Discovery)**. That is the same shape as a production method's gate, so
the mod's `bag_wtp_avail_*` machinery covers it with nothing new.

## The three things that are not obvious

**1. A right's percentage cannot re-rank anything.** `+20% books` is the same
+20% in every location in the world. Multiply every candidate by 1.2 and the
order is what it was. The same goes for the efficiency penalty: one constant,
shared by eleven rights, applied to every candidate equally. So a mod that
"takes town rights into account" while still answering for one good has done
nothing at all — a whole feature that changes no answer.

**What re-ranks is the bundle.** Eight of the nine general rights cover two or
three goods, and a province's RGO bonus is *per good*: it can supply lumber and
not dyes. So «where do I put Printing Rights» is a real question with a
different answer from «where do I make books», and it is the only question here
worth a pass.

**2. Adding a bundle's goods needs a common unit, and the mod's is the gain.**
Four books a level and 0.3 masonry a level are not addable; that is the same
mistake as ranking a forest village above a weapon guild, which cost the ninth
run. What the plan adds is each bundle good's **gain** — the fraction of that
good's own ceiling this ground pays — divided by the whole bundle, so a charter
delivering one good of three is worth a third of one delivering all three. The
price-weighted sum written here before is what the *single-right window* scores
on; the plan never used it.

**3. A level right is a different unit, and the mod refuses to add it to the
others.** Settled 2026-09-02: score a right by *which goods it favours* and never
by the size or the kind of the favour, because a building's level cap moves as a
location grows. The arithmetic that was written for the other answer — five levels
against +20%, and the owner's worry about a cap of 3 against a cap of 15 — is in
[`../archive/town_rights_levels.md`](../archive/town_rights_levels.md); it is what
still decides Flemish cloth against royal textile.

## Built 2026-08-31, and running since 2026-09-03

The output half is in — the plan grants a charter to every town and puts its
whole bundle up, and the owner has seen it: «города получают права и домики из
прав». A third list on the Goods tab, exclusive with the two goods lists, and **a
second window** rather than a third line on the first: a bundle is a different
question in a different unit, and that was his call.

How the window is put together — the pass reusing the per-good scorers, the three
fixed slots, `RIGHT_SCALE`, and the one guess in the list registration — is in
[`../archive/town_rights_window.md`](../archive/town_rights_window.md).

## Five things read off the files on 2026-09-02

Read rather than remembered, because the owner asked to be checked against the
game and not believed: «я могу ошибаться и в целом работаю из условностей
воспоминаний».

- **There are 41 rights in the game and the mod scores 12** — `output_rights()`
  keeps only those that raise an output. Everything else is levels, marketplaces
  or population, and is not offered at all.
- **Every country-specific right is `kept_at_conquest = no`. The nine general
  Discovery ones carry no such line, so they are kept.** That matters for this
  mod more than for the game: it plans ground you have not taken, and a right on
  ground you conquer is gone the moment it is yours. You can grant it again if
  you pass its `potential`, which is what the plan already checks.
- **Flemish cloth and `royal_textile_rights` are mutually exclusive**, and the
  game says so itself — both `allow` blocks name the other. So «which of them has
  priority» is not a question the game answers; it only forbids the pair **in one
  town**, and the choice is the player's. **`scope:target` there is the town and
  not the country, and reading it as a country rule cost two charters.** Eight
  pairs in the game carry such an `allow`; derived as «the country grants the
  excluder instead», it took `royal_naval_rights` and `royal_tooling_rights` away
  from every Scandinavian country — in both the window and the plan — in favour of
  the privileges that exclude them, at +20%/+20% and +10% against +30%. Fixed
  2026-09-03: the plan grants a town one right, so no pair can bind on it, and the
  single preference the mod holds is written down as one (`PREFERRED_RIGHT`).
- **The per-location limit is a modifier, `local_possible_town_rights`**
  («Определяет, сколько городских прав может быть у района»). **Nothing in
  `reference/` pushes it**, so the base and any per-rank steps are not knowable
  from here — they will be in `common/defines`, which the manifest does not
  extract. The owner's recollection is town +1, city +1, megalopolis +1, and it
  is his recollection and not a reading. **`capital_possible_town_rights` is
  readable**: four advances grant +1 each — Discovery, Reformation, Absolutism,
  Revolutions — so a capital ends the game with four extra.
- **`town_right_efficiency_penalty` is still defined in nothing we hold** (it
  will be in `common/defines`, which the manifest does not extract). **The owner
  states it as 5%, twice and flatly** — «штраф у всех прав 5%, я тебе это точно
  говорю» — so that is the figure to print if a row ever prints one. **It changes no answer the mod gives**:
  eleven rights carry the same constant, it applies to the whole location, and
  the plan grants a right to every town — so it cancels out of every comparison
  the mod makes. Worth knowing to explain a row, not to compute one.

## The owner's ruling on levels, 2026-09-02

**The mod must never score building levels.** «Мы смотрим на общие ячейки,
каждая из которых линейка в высоту какого-то домика, не важно будет их там 3 в
высоту или 13. Это число непостоянно и все локации растут — высчитывать это
полный абсурд.» So the level half is not deferred any more; it is out of scope by
decision, and `guild_max_level` above is not to be built into a score.

**But he also wants every right usable**: «не важно право это на бонус
производительности или на лимит домиков — все полезны и все по идее должны
использоваться… все права равны должны быть». Those two together point at one
rule, and it is not built: **score every right by how well the ground suits the
goods it favours, whatever kind of bonus it gives** — a level right for cloth and
fine cloth is scored on cloth and fine cloth, exactly like an output right, and
never on the levels. Undecided and his to call.

**The ages, and flemish cloth against royal textile** — which advance opens what,
why «a weaponry charter where cannons cannot be built» cannot happen in play, why
the plan does not gate on `has_advance` after all, and the computation he asked
for on the two cloth charters — are in
[`../archive/town_rights_ages.md`](../archive/town_rights_ages.md). All settled,
one of them by a run that made the answer worse.

## How the charters are spread, settled 2026-09-03 over three runs

**The rule the owner set is evenness, and he set it twice.** «Я не буду
удовлетворён пока не увижу в вестфалии относительно одинаковое количество
каждого городского права… и мне похуй что там в формулах», then, when seven of
nine came out at six and two at three: «у пушек ювелирки по 3 … но вот с пушками
я на такое не согласен, им есть чё взять».

**A quota is a ceiling and a ceiling does not spread anything.** The pass walks
towns; each town takes the best charter that still has room. A charter the ground
pays 62 for is never any town's best while a rival at 441 has room left, so it
gets only the towns nobody else wanted — three of forty-eight in Westphalia,
against a quota of six. Both runs that measured this are in
[`../TESTLOG.md`](../TESTLOG.md); the second is the one that named the cause,
because `RQ` prints each town's whole valuation and weaponry is last in every one
of them.

**So the ceiling climbs by one and the whole ladder of bands runs at each
height.** `_rlevel` goes 1, 2, 3 …, and at each height the five bands run in
descending order; a charter may hold at most `_rlevel` towns. **No charter takes
an Nth town until every charter has had the chance of its Nth**, which is the
evenness; the bands inside a level decide *which* town, which is the merit.
Level 1 is exactly the covering ladder that used to be a special case with a flag
of its own — `_rn<k> < 1` is `_rn<k> = 0` — so that case and its flag are gone.

- **The ceiling it climbs to** is `_rquota`, towns ÷ grantable charters, floored
  at 1. On 48 towns and 9 charters that is 5.33, so the ladder runs six levels
  and every charter ends on five or six.
- **The guard is `RIGHT_LEVELS`**, twelve, because `_rquota` on a large ground
  with two grantable charters would otherwise walk the whole ground a hundred
  times. Past it the ladder runs once more at the full quota. `WTP PASS` prints
  `rquota` and `rlevels`, and the two differing is the guard having bitten — the
  only trace it leaves.
- **The open pass after all of it** lifts the ceiling and the band together, so a
  town no charter fits on merit still ends with one.
- **The price is a town that would rather have had another charter**, and the
  owner set that price himself. It is the same objection that was raised against
  the band-0 pass on 2026-09-03 and overruled the same day.

**Run 2026-09-03, and it came out as predicted**: five or six at every charter,
`rquota=5 rlevels=6`.

**How good is the placement? 84.3% of the best possible, and that is measured.**
`_rq<k>` is a static script value -- the bundle's gains added and divided by the
bundle -- so the numbers the dump prints are the numbers the pass used, and the
assignment problem can be solved exactly afterwards from a press's own report.
The plan gave **21246**; the best assignment with the same counts is **25189**.
`tools/` has no solver in it: this was one throwaway script over the report, and
the method is a note here rather than a tool because it answers a question that
is now answered.

**Two alternatives were measured on those numbers and both are worse.**

- **Walking charters instead of towns** -- each charter takes its best free town
  in its band -- gives **18526**. A charter early in the order takes a town a
  later one needed more; letting each town state its own preference beats it.
- **Finer bands.** Averaged over 40 random walk orders: 5 bands 22969, 10 bands
  21927, 20 bands 21370, 50 bands 21889. Mellower granularity is not better here,
  it is worse, because a coarse band lets more towns compete inside it.

**What would close the gap is a swap pass**, and it is not built. After the
ladder, two towns exchange charters whenever the sum rises: on these numbers +8%
and **97.8% of the optimum**, in about twelve swaps, with the counts preserved by
construction. It needs the grant split in two -- the ladder deciding `_plan_right`
without planting, then one walk planting every bundle -- because a swap after the
buildings are down would leave them behind.

**And the cost of evenness is now measured too**: 141 of 192 buildings earned a
bonus before the levelling ladder and 128 after, 73% against 67%. Ровные грамоты
стоят земле примерно шестую часть бонуса.

**Not run.** The ladder is arithmetic on the same numbers the last press printed,
so the prediction is exact — weaponry and jewelry at five, nothing else below
five — but nothing here has been in the game.

## What is undecided

- **Nothing about the level rights any more.** He settled it on 2026-09-02 —
  «включай в расчёт все подобные домики, считай их как ты посчитал фламандское
  сукно» — and the merge admits exactly one, flemish cloth, because the only
  other level rights grant marketplace levels and no method produces a
  marketplace. Its own `potential` (Netherlandish culture group) is what keeps it
  off everyone else — **and Westphalian is in that group**, read off
  `cultures/german.txt` on 2026-09-03, which is why Münster's towns take Flemish
  cloth and never royal textile. The advance gate came later and for a different
  reason: «Сейчас» asks it, «В конце» does not.
- **Whether a town that suits no right at all should still get one.** The plan
  grants a right where the town can make at least one of its goods; if none of
  the twelve passes, the town gets none. It has not happened on any ground run so
  far.
- **The row.** A bundle is up to three goods, so a row wants three answers where
  it has two. A row can hold a fixed number of them and not a variable one:
  script has no list of tuples, and the answers are parked as flat variables on
  the location. Three fixed slots, not a datamodel.

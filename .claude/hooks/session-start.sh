# Hand a fresh session the state of the tree — in about a hundred tokens.
#
# What a session needs at minute zero is the facts the documents cannot keep
# current on their own, because the owner refreshes `reference/` by hand and
# without notice: what is in the tree, whether the generated files still match
# it, and whether the documents still describe files that exist.
#
# It used to hand back every generator's full report — six paragraphs of counts
# that are correct, uninteresting while they are unchanged, and paid for on
# every turn of the session afterwards. So it now says only what is *wrong* or
# *moved*, and one line when nothing is. The full report is one command away:
# `python3 tools/refresh.py --check`.
